# GET NEXT LÄ°NE

## Objectives
int get_next_line(int fd, char **line)

-Calling the function in a loop will read the text available on a file descriptor one line at a time until EOF.
-Return 1 when a line has been read, 0 when EOF has been reached, -1 when an error happened.
-Able to manage multiple file descriptors.

## What to know
### Static variable
-Remains while the program is running.
-Is allocated memory in data segment

| Difference between global and static variable is that static variable cannot be accessed from other files. |

## Why using static variable
-We need to call get_next_line until EOF, so we need a static variable to hold a line read with the amount of BUFFER_SIZE until the program ends.

## File descriptor
-An abstract indicator used to access a file in Unix and related computer operating systems.
-Open returns file descriptor that are not allocated.
-0 is for standard input, 1 is for standard output, 2 is for standard error.

## Implementation
-get_next_line will read a file with the amount of BUFFER_SIZE and determine if the string is a line or not.
-If the string read is not a line, a function will read a file with same amount again.
| static char *saved[OPEN_MAX] |
-OPEN_MAX defined in <limits.h>, is the maximum number of files that one process can have open at any one time.
-Used double pointer to manage strings from n files.
-Will hold lines read until the program ends.
| char buf[BUFFER_SIZE + 1] |
-Temporary array that will hold a string read with the amount of BUFFER_SIZE.
-Will be joined with saved string.

## Steps

1. Check if static variable saved[fd] includes new line.
-> If yes, copy a string in saved[fd] until a new line to a given variable line.
-> Then, saved[fd] will be overwritten into saved[fd] after a new line.
2. Read a file with the amount of BUFFER_SIZE.
-> Join existing saved[fd] with buf.
-> Return to step 1.

## What to be careful
### Memory leaks
-Malloc will be used in ft_strjoin and ft_strdup.
-saved[fd] will be overwritten with new memory allocation.
-> Previous saved[fd] should be freed.
## BUFFER_SIZE
-Since char buf[BUFFER_SIZE] is allocated in stack memory, if a function reads more than available stack size, it will cause stack overflow.
-> Set as global or static variable that will be allocated in data segment.
-> Allocate in heap memory using malloc.
-> Manually increase stack memory size.
